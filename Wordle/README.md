A game started getting popular on the internet called wordle, where you guess 5 letter words. My friends and I wanted to know if 5 letter words have a different distribution that all the other words, after seeing clickbait news articles saying they're the same. Turns out, they're not. Compared against [this commonly used list](https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/cryptography/letterfrequencies.html), the distributions are similar, but letters like K, S, and Y are more common relative to other letters in 5 letter words than in the whole dictionary. One conclusion of this is that "arose" is the 5 letter word that's most likely to share a letter with a random 5 letter word, while "irate" is the most likely for any randomly picked word. 

<sup>NOTE: this conclusion doesn't account for how not having one letter effects the likelyhood of having others. My guess is that if you accounted for this, the most likely word would be aurei, because it has four vowels and the 2nd most common consonant in 5 letter words
